# Pokémon Dataset Analysis Findings

## Overview
In this project, I analyzed the Pokémon dataset to uncover several key insights and findings related to legendary Pokémon, correlations between attributes, type strengths, and optimal team composition.

## Findings

### 1. Legendary Pokémon Classifier
- Successfully built a classifier to identify legendary Pokémon based on their attributes.

### 2. Correlation Analysis
- Height and weight of a Pokémon show low correlation with its various base stats.
- Experience Growth and Egg Steps are weakly correlated, with Egg Steps being influenced by the legendary status of Pokémon.

### 3. Type Strengths
- Dragon-type Pokémon emerged as the strongest type in terms of battle prowess.
- Psychic-type Pokémon are more likely to be legendary compared to other types.

### 4. Optimal Team Composition
- Discovered an optimal team of 6 Pokémon that maximize damage while remaining relatively impervious to opposing teams:
  - 'Rayquaza'
  - 'Latias'
  - 'Shiftry'
  - 'Surskit'
  - 'Armaldo'
  - 'Pyroar'

## Methodology
- Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Utilized exploratory data analysis techniques.
- Applied machine learning algorithms for classification tasks.
- Employed optimization algorithms to determine the optimal team composition.

## Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into the world of Pokémon, showcasing the effectiveness of data analysis and machine learning in deriving meaningful conclusions and optimizing strategic decisions in Pokémon battles.
